# MinimaxChess

For a Computer Data Structures and Algorithms course (CSC190) we designed a chess game that could be played against other players or against the CPU. In order to implement the CPU a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning was implemented using binary trees. The CPU player was able to see moves 3 steps ahead and make the moves educated move in order to maximize its score while minimizing its opponent's score.
